# Karatsuba-Closest-Pair-Visualizer
# Overview

This project is a web-based visualization tool for two well-known divide-and-conquer algorithms:
Closest-Pair Algorithm: Identifies the closest pair of points in a 2D plane efficiently with a time complexity of O(n log n), an improvement over the brute-force O(n²) method.
Karatsuba Algorithm: Performs fast long-integer multiplication with a time complexity of O(n¹.⁵⁸⁵), compared to the traditional brute-force O(n²) method.
The project helps users understand these algorithms by providing an interactive visual representation of their execution.

# Features
✅ Interactive Visualization: Step-by-step execution of both algorithms.
✅ Closest-Pair Algorithm: Plots points dynamically and illustrates how pairs are checked.
✅ Karatsuba Algorithm: Shows two variations—detailed step-by-step breakdown and tree visualization.
✅ Web-Based: Implemented using JavaScript, HTML, and CSS, with animations for better understanding.
